Makai Rentals is a water sports rental app solution that enables other businesses and individuals to incorporate and/or start a water sports equipment rental service (as a franchisee). Makai Rentals is an MVP, and due to the proprietary nature of the code, I can only provide code snippets. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code for the Appointment and SysAdminView features.
